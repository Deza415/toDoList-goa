# TodoList-Goa Backend

## The stuff so far

- Ran `goa init todolist` to "scaffold" the project
- Created `design/todo.go` to define the API using Goa DSL
- Ran `goa gen` to generate service definitions and transport layers
- Ran `goa example` to "scaffold" a working HTTP server
- Ran `go mod tidy` to resolve dependencies
- Ran the service with `go run ./cmd/todo` â€” it's live at http://localhost:80
