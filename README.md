## The stuff so far

- Ran `goa init todolist` to outline the project
- Created `design/todo.go` to define the API using Goa DSL
- Ran `goa gen` to generate service definitions and transport layers
- Ran `goa example` to make a basic outline  a working HTTP server
- Ran `go mod tidy` to resolve dependencies
